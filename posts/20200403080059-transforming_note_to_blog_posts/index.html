        <h1>Transforming note to blog posts</h1></header><p>Writing blog is a great way to force myself to polish the writings,
improving my notes in term of writing, clarity and idea. I keep a lots
of notes with many different ideas and thoughts, but they are not well
maintained. As a result, they are not very useful for myself or for
others. Turning these notes into blog posts are a great way.</p>
<p>However, the blog posts I am working on is somewhat detached from my
own org system. It&rsquo;s this system that contains the knowledge. It&rsquo;s
only natural to have the blog posts to be <strong>another view</strong> of the
knowledge base, or the main system. Put it this way, the blog posts
are basically outlet of notes that I am happy about. Period. Nothing
more and certainly nothing less.</p>
<p>The solution is a way to publish new blog posts directly from the org
notes. Put it in another way, I need to <strong>publish my org notes</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo">ox-hugo</a> is great. I can use it to generate new blog posts in
markdown. Further more, writing stuffs in my org-wiki is much better
for retrieving information later.</p>
