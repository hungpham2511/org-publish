      <description>Table of Contents  Why? Solution Citations    Why? Keeping lots of notes I keep a lots of notes with many different ideas and thoughts, but they are not well maintained. As a result, they are not very useful for myself or for others. Turning some of these notes into blog posts can be useful.
Also publish writings is a great way to force one to polish the skill, to focus on making concise ideas and to improve the clarity of one&amp;rsquo;s own ideas.</description>
