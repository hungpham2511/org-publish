      <description>In this short note, I recap the absolute minimum understanding to work with discrete-time signals and systems. These are by no mean complete, and might not be completely technically correct, as sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easier to state a less precise statement for the sake of clarity. Now, for a very nice course on this topic have a look at [this MIT open courseware][1] or this [coursera course from EPFL][coursera]
Discrete-time signal A discrete-time signal \(x[n]\) is essentially an array of floats.</description>

      <description>Continuous time system, s-domain. With the basis in physics, allowing physical intuition that aids understanding.
Discrete time system z-domain. Allow fast and convenient implementation for digital computational systems.
Conversion with bilinear transform.
Frequency response of continuous time system G(s) is basically G(jw) where w is the angular velocity in radian per second.
Frequency response of discrete time system H(z) is different, as there is no notion of seconds,
H(ejw), where 0 &amp;lt;= w &amp;lt;= 2pi</description>

      <description>Writing blog is a great way to force myself to polish the writings, improving my notes in term of writing, clarity and idea. I keep a lots of notes with many different ideas and thoughts, but they are not well maintained. As a result, they are not very useful for myself or for others. Turning these notes into blog posts are a great way.
However, the blog posts I am working on is somewhat detached from my own org system.</description>
